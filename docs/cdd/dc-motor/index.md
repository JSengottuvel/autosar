# Demonstration of DC motor driver using automotive grade HBridge VNH7070AS


Goal : Drive the motor at different speeds and with different PWM frequency, while monitoring the current sense feedback from HBridge.

This is a sort video demonstration explaining typical development setup for a DC motor driver & current monitoring. This also studies the current sense out of HBridge at different PWM frequency.

This is a simple driver and is preliminary. I admit that I am a beginner in this area.

Looking for an expert advice for a reliable current measurement at switching frequency 16 to 20khz.

Feel free to share your views and ideas that could enable reliable current measurement. 

It could be anything from a recommendation for enhancing sensing circuit to changing a digital filter on simulink model.
